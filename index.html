			<h3>THE SPACE</h3>
			<p>Space is the vast region with no known boundaries beyond the Earth's atmosphere.The space is the empty area extending in all direction to infinity.The solar system,the stars,galactic dust and galaxies regions between the galaxies all form parts of the space.It has no atmosphere.It appears black during the day as well as at night.It does not inhabit any living organism.Man has been trying to collect information about the space with the help of powerful telescopes,rockets,satellities,space-crafts and space probes.The space explorations have revealed many mysteries of the space  and enhanced the man's knowledge about it.</p><br>

			<h3>THE STARS</h3>
			<p>The stars are huge spheres of glowing gases.Stars vary considerably in size,color,temperature,brightness ad distanc from the Earth.The Sun is also a medium sized star.It is comparatively nearer to the Earth hence it looks bigger in size.Stars appear to twinkle because they are seen through the Earth's atmosphere.The stars also seen to move from east to west acoss the sky.This,"movement" is actually caused by the spinning of the Earth.Stars are often classified according to their size.The four major sizes are super giant,giant,medium and dwarf.</p><br>

			<p>The colour of a star indicates its surface temperature.The hottest stars are blue.Red stars are somewhat  cooler having a temperature of about 2800C.The Sun and other yellow stars have surface temperature of about 5500C.Rigel the blue-white giant star has a diameter 80 times larger than that of the Sun and is 60,000 times brighter.A spacecraft takes three days to reach the moon from the Earth.It will take several months to reach the Sun and may take thousands of years to reach the nearest star.Such long distances covered in months and  years are very difficult to be measured in kilometers.Therefore,scientists use units like Light Year and Parsec(PC) for measuring the distances of stars.A Light Year is the distance  trvelled by light in oneyear at a speed of 3,00,00 km per second;it is equal to  9.4607 x 10<sup>12</sup>km.1 Parsec is equal to 3.26 LIGHT YEARS OR 30.857 x 10<sup>12</sup>km.</p><br>

			

			<p>It takes 1.3 seconds for the moonlight to  come for us.The Sunlight reaches the Earth in 8 minutes 18 seconds.It should take 4.2 light years for the light to reach the Earth from Proxima Centauri,the nearest star next to the Sun.The farthest star in our galaxy lies at a  distance of about 63,000 light years(19.325 Parsec)</p><br>


			<h3>PULSARS,BLACK HOLES AND QUASARS</h3>
			<p>Pulsars are rapidly spinning stars that emit pulses of radio waves at regualr intervals.The word pulsar stands for Pulsating Radio  Star.When a big star explodes,its outer shell  scatters to form a nebula hile its core  contracts into a denser star called the neutron  star.Its neutrons  are tightly compressed and  it has extrememly  high density.Neutron stars are very small and dull.Average diameter of a neutron star ids 10km.These neutron stars are called pulsars.</p><br>

			<p>Radio pulses coming from pulsars produce 'tick' like sound on radio telescope.The neutron stars are like lighthouses in the space.Ordinary pulsars  flash at an interval of every one or half a second.The most rapid flashing pulsar  NP 0532 lies in the Crab Nebula and  emits 30 pulses per second.The oldest and the least frequency pulsar is NP 0527 which the least frequency pulsar is NP 0527 which  emits pulses every 3.7 seconds.All pulsars  emit pulses at a rate of one pulse per 0.03 second to one pulse per 4 seconds.Most of the pulsars are not visible  through optical telescopes.They may be observed with the help of radio telescopes.Only two pulsars - NP 0532 in the Crab Nebula and  PSR 0833-35 in Gum Nebula can be seen  wih the help of  optical telescopes.Scientists  hzve so far discovered more than 100 pulsars</p><br>

			<p>When very big stars.three times bigger than the Sub,collapse by the force of their own gravity,some black regions are created in the space.These are called black holes.They  have gravitational force so enormously high that no matter not even ight  can escape from it.The first black hole was detected in 1972.It was in a binary star of Cygnusx-1 which is a  powerful source of X-rays.It is a  small member of the binary star,which is completely black.It is not a neutrob star and  therefore it is called black hole.Normally black holes emit X-rays and infrared radiation which help in their detection in the space..The mass of black holes may be equal to that  of 100 million Suns.</p><br>

			<p>Quasar is an abbreviated form of Quasi Stellar Radio sources.Quarsars appear like a  star.Through an optical telescope they look  like an ordinary dull star,but radio telescope observations have indicated that they are the  source of radi waves.Quasar 3C-273 was  discovered by Maarten Schmidt in 1962.The value of its red-shift was 0.158.Red-shift  is an effect of change in frequency and is  seen in moving objects .If the object is approaching,its light will shft towards the violet  end of the spectrum,and if the object is  moving away,the light will shift to the red end of the spectrum,Red-shift indicates that the  source of light was receding away.Quasars emit radio waves and X-rays with light.The size of a quasar is 1/100,000 of outr galaxy but its brightness is 100-200 times more.So far 1500 quasars have been discovered.</p><br>


			<h3>GALAXIES</h3>
			<p>In night,a white milky bond of light is seen in the sky.It is called Milky Way.Italian astronomer Galileo was the first to observe it with the  help of his telescope and declared that it was a giant cluster of millions of stars.It is a  galaxy.It comprises numerous solar systems and our solar system is one of its members.Galaxies are giant clusters of stars held  together by their mutual power of gravitation.Because of their vastness they are called 'peninsulas of the universe'.Millions of galaxies may be seen with the help of a powerful telescope.They lie at a distance of 1000 to 1,00,00,000 light years.Most of the galaxies appear scattered in the sky.</p><br>

			<p>It is assumed that huge masses of gases or proto-galaxies were formed as a result of the premordial explosion in the universe and they started rotating on their own speed.Galaxies owe their different and forms to their varying speed.Galaxies so far known are spiral,elliptical and irregular in shape.Ours is a spiral galaxy.Its spiral arms are widespread.Our solar system lies near the edge of the galaxy.Our galaxy measures about 100,000 light years (30,600pc).Its centre is covered under galatic dust particles and lies at  about 32,000 light years (9800 pc) from the Sun.Our galaxy is estimated to be 12,000 to 14,000 million years old and contains around 100,000 million stars.</p><br>

			<p>Our galaxy rotates on its axis-faster at the centre than at the edges.The middle part completes one rotation on its axis in about 50,000 years.The Sun and its neighbouring stars revolve round the centre of the galaxy in their orbit at an average speed of 250 km per second.It takes about 255 million years for the Sun to make one completer rotation.This period is called 'cosmic year'.</p><br>



			<h3>THE SUN</h3>
			<p>The Sun is one of the stars in the milky way.It looks bigger than other stars because it is  the closest star to the Earth.However,it is smaller than some other stars.Betelgeuse,a red giant star is 800 times bigger than the Sun.The Sun lies about 150 million km.from the Earth.Its diameter is about  1,400,000km;i.e;109 times the Earth's diameter.Iion is 28  times more than the  gravitation of the Earth.The Sun lies at a distance of about 32,000 light years from the centre  of the galaxy.It takes the Sun about 225 million years to complete one revolution around the  centre of the galaxy with a speed of 250 km. per second.This period is called cosmic year.The Sunmlike the Earth,rotates on its axis as well.It is a gaseous  mass and therefore  can rotate at varying speeds at different latitudes.It rotates once  on its axis in 24-25 days at the poles and 34-37 days at the equator.</p><br>

			<p>The Sun is composed of about 75% hydrogen and almost 25% helium.It amy be called a big hydrogen bomb because it releases huge amount of heat and light as a result of nuclear fussion.The Sun is directly responsible for all life on Earth.It provides the Earth with all of its light,heat and energy.The glowing surface of the Sun whichwe see is called photosphere.It has a temperature of about 6000 Celsius while the  temperature of the core is  15,000,000 Celsius.The glowing flames constantly arising  from the photosphere are called 'solar prominences' which rise up to 1,000,000 km. height.The dark spots noticed on the surface of the Sun are called 'Sun-spots'.They are cooler than the surrounding area.The life  span of sunspots varies froma few hours to   many weeks,Larger Sunspots may have temperature up to 4000-5000 Celsius.Some of them are made of many folded layers than our Earth's size.When Sunspots persist for longer periods,they cause solar flares and high solar  prominences which create upheavals in the  ionosphere resulting with disturbances in our radio communications.</p><br>


			<h3>THE SOLAR SYSTEM</h3>
			<p>The solar system is located at a distance of about 30,000 light years from the centre of the Milky way galaxy.The Sun is a star like other stars with the only difference that it is nearer to us as compared to other stars.It has a family of its own.The Sun and  its family put together is called the solar system.The solar system consists of nine planets,their satellities,asteroids,comets meteoroids and other debris.Planets are the heavenly bodies which like our Earth revolve round the Sun,They do not have their own light.They look bright as the Sun's light falls on them and reflected from their surfaces.The nine planets are-Mercury,Venus,Earth,Mars,Jupiter,Saturn,Uranus,Neptune and Pluto.</p><br>

			<p>Mercury,Venus,Jupiter and Saturn may be seen from the Earth with naked eyes.These wereknown to the astronomers thousands of years ago.Three planets namely Uranus,Neptune and Pluto were discovered  later after the invention of telescope.Uranus was discovered in 1781,Neptune in 1846 and Pluto in 1930.In the recent years,astronomers have tried to explore the possibility of existence of a tenth planet.But they have not been able to discover it so far.There is also a fair cahnce of discovering  more moons,especially around Jupiter and Saturn.</p><br>

			<h3>THE MERCURY</h3>
			<p>Mercury is a small planet closest to tthe Sun.It is smaller than some of the small satellities of the planets.Because of its nearness to the Sun and its small size,it is difficult o see it without  "a telescope but it can be seen easily immediately after the Sunset or before the Sunrise.It takes Mercury 58.7 Earth days to  make a complete rotation on its axis and 88 days to make a complete  orbit around the  Sun.It is the fastest rotating planet.The distance of Mercury from the Sun does not remain constant because it has a  long narrow orbit resembling a lemon in shape.It moves very slowly.Its one day is  equal to 59 days of our Earth.</p><br>

			<p>One part of this planet is always in the  Sunlight for a longer period to raise day's temperature over 350 Celsius,enough to  melt tin and lead.The other part of the planet  where it is night,the temperature is as low as -170 Celsius.Mercury is like the moo.It has rocks,cliffs and craters.It has no satellite and no atmosphere.</p><br>

			<h3>THE VENUS</h3>
			<p>You must have seen a very bright star in the evening.It is visible in the morning  also.Often it is called the 'Morning Star' or the 'Evening Star'.However,it is not a star but a planet,called Venus,the one nearest to the  Earth.It is the second planet from the Sun.Through telescope it looks like our moon.We  get its full view when it is very far away from us.It is the brightest of all the planets.Many new facts about Venus have come  to light by space probes.Venus is the hottest  planet in the solar system.On equator its temperature rises up to 480 Celsius.Lead,tin and zinc melt at this temperature.Venus  has very thick clouds which reach up to a  height of 55 km.Thick clouds make studies of the planet's surface nearly impossible.The temperature of clouds on higher level on the Venus drops down to -35 Celsius.This red hot planet is shrouded by icy clouds.The atmosphere on this planet contains  90 to 95 percent of carbon dioxide.Some  hydrogen and water vapour are also present,Its surface atmospheric pressure is 100 times more than on the Earth.No astronaut can survive in the atmosphere of Venus,nor can tolerate its excessive heat.Radio waves have indicated that there are mountains and valleys on this planet.The planet has no satellities.The Sun rises in the west and sets in the east on this planet.</p>

			<h3>THE EARTH</h3>
			<p>Our home planet,the Earth,is the third planet of the solar family.It is the only planet in the solar system were life exists.The Earth too like another planets revolves round the Sun.It spins on is axis,one end of which is called the north pole and the other south pole.One half of the Earth that recieves Sunlight is hot during summer while the other half has winter during that period.Thus the seasons on our Earth change alternatively.Yuri Gagarin,the Russian astronaut was the first to orbit the Earth once in his spacecraft Vostokin 1961:He looked at the Earth from the space.From the space or the moon the Earth appears full of greenery  and blue water of oceans similiar to that as dipicted on the globe.Many of its parts hidden under the  white clouds are not visible from the space.The moon is the only satellite of the Earth</p><br>

			<h3>THE MOON</h3>
			<p>The moon is the only satellite of the Earth.Astrononmers believe that both the Earth and the moon came into existence separately but at the same time from gasesand dust remaining from the Su's formation.Samples of the moon's rocks and soil brought to the Earth by the astronauts have shown that the moon is of the same age as the Earth and was formed about 4600 million years ago.
			The mean distance etween the Earth and the Moon is 3,84,400 km.Moon's surface area is 37,940,000 sq,km.There is a large number of craters on the surface  of the moon created by meteroids collisions, and volcanic activiyt of the past.The moon has high mountains with gentle slopes.They have either raised sharp peaks nor steep slopes.Devoid of water and air and hence  the moon is unable to sustain life.The day  dawnss suddenly and the night also approaches in the same manner.There is no sound either because of total absence of air and atmosphere.The moon's gravity is about one-sixth of the Earth;s gravity.If you can jump up to 1 meter on the Earth,you will jump upto 6.05 meters on the moon .Similiarly ,an object that weighs 6 kg on Earth,will weigh 1kg on the moon.The day temperature rises to 120 Celsius while the night temperature  drops to -160  Celsius on the moon.On July 20,1969,the Appollo 11 astronaut Neil Amrstrong became the first person to set foot on the moon.Several other explorations fromthe USA followed durimg which many experiments were conducted.The data obtained  has vastly increased our knowledge of the moon.</p><br>

			<p>The Sunlight falls only on one side of the  surface of the moon.The other side is always  in dark.The moon revolves round the Earth in 22.3 days.It has no light of its own.The moon looks bright,when the Sunlight isreflected  from its surface.The moon does not look always alike.Its shape keeps on changing  during the month.These different shapes  of the moon are called its phases.The moon is  not visible at all when it comes between the  Earth and the Sun.We have full moon when the Sun is on the other side of the Earth.When the Earth passes directly  the Sun and the moon,lunar eclipse occus.It happens only on full moon nights.The gravitational pull of the moon causes tides.Although the Sun too is responsible for  the tides,but the moon being nearer  to the Earth than the Sun exerts greater pull on sea.</p><br>

			<h3>THE MARS</h3>
			<p>Mars is the forth plane fromthe Sun.It is  about half of our Earth's size in diameter.It is  also called the red planet because of its  reddish orange appearance in the sky.Like that of the Earth the axis of rotation of Mars  is tilted in space and its pola regions face the Sun alternatel giving it seasons of summer and winter in the northern and southern  hemispheres.Although stories have been written and even films have been made about this planet and its inhabitants,but the space investigations have proved that there is no life on Mars.</p><br>

			<p>The pictures recieved from the space probe Mariner 9 indicate the existence of deep depressions =,dusty valleys and raised landmasses on the Mars.There are more  volcanoes on Mars than on the Earth.Nix Olympia,an extinct volcano on the Mars is  three times more in height than the Mt.Everest,Its height is 24km from the surface of the planet and consists  huge snow caves measuring up to 65 km in length.The Viking space probes(Viking 1 and Viking 2Sent to Mars in 1976 to explore the possibility of existence of life on the planet have shown that there was no life there.It is  no wonder because the temperature on the planet never rises over the freezing point.There is no water either.Mars has two satellities-the Phoboa and the Deimos.Phobos is larger than Deimos </p><br>

			<h3>THE JUPITER</h3>
			<p>The Jupiter,the fith planet from the Sun is the larges planet in the solar system.It is 318 times more massive than the Earth.It is so large 1300 Earths could fit into it..Made up of gases,it has features of both,a star and a  planet.All planets recieve energy from the  Sun but the Jupiter spreads its radio energy,produced by explosion,in long wave-lengths.This planet has the most powerful radio waves next to the Sun in our solar system.Jupiter's atmosphere contains mainly hydrogen and helium.Methane and ammonia are also present in traces.Its atmosphere  is like that of prehistoric Earth.Hydrogen,Methane,Ammonia and water which were responsible for evolution on life on the Earth might have possibly set in motion the process of evolution of life on this planet.The first space probe Pioneer X reached the Jupiter at the close of 1973.It showed that the planet had magnetosphere.The radio waves coming fromthe magnetosphere stillcontinue to be a mysteryfor the scientists who believe that there is some life on jupiter. </p><br>

			<p>In 1979,Voyager 1 an Voyager 2 passed this planet.The closest picture of the  Jupiter was taken from a distance of 1.8 million km.A 30 km thick ring around the  planet was also observed.Existence of volcanoes and elelments like sulphur and oxygen on one of the satellities of the planet named  lo,were also detected.Europa,another satellite of the planet  and equal to our moon in size is coveredunder ice at several places 100 km thick ice layers.Jupiter is always covered under clouds.There are five bright and four dark grey bands around it.A mysterious oval-shaped red spot about three times larger than the Earth is visible on its surface.It is a persistant storm that appears to be a permanent feature of the palnet.It covers an area 40,000km, long and 4,000 km.wide.Jupiter has 16 satellities four of which are several thousand kilometers in diameter.</p><br>

			<h3>THE SATURN</h3>
			<p>The Saturn,the second largest planet in the solar system,is the sixth planet in terms of distance from the Sun.It is the loveliest among the planets.Like its neighbour Jupiter,the Saturn also resembles a ball of gases but smaller in size.It is 95 times more massive than the Earth.The magificant system of this planet has made it mysterious.Spread over a distance of about 275,000 km.these rings revolve round the planet.Investigations made by space probes 	Voyager-1 and Voyager-2 have revealed that these rings are made up of innumerable ice covered particles.The Voyagers helped in measuring  these particles,which have diameter of a few centimeters to 8 meters.The rings number is  more than 1000.</p><br>

			<p>Like the Jupiter.the Saturn also has a red spot on its surface although smaller in size.It contains white elliptical and banded light dense clouds.It is yellowish in colour.Saturn faces very strong winds with a speed of about 1,760 km. per hour.Its surface temperature is -180 Celsius</p><br>

			<p>After the discovery of the Neptune,astronomers continued their efforts in search of another planet still farther in the space.It was in 1930 that C.W.Tombaugh discovered the Pluto which is slightly smaller than the planet Mercury.The Sun shines over it for about 6 hours 30 minutes only.It is very cold.It 's surface temperature  is -230 Celsius.The Sun looks like a bright star from the surface of  this planet.The pluto has no atmosphere.It is like a  rocky ball.spaceman may land on this planet  but he willhave to put on space suit tonprotect himself against cold and also to carry oxygen for breathing.This planet has only one satellite.Its axis bisects the Neptune's orbit and therefore it is presumed to be a satellite broken away from the the Neptune</p><br>

			<h3>ASTERIODS</h3>
			<p>Planets and their moons are major members of the solar system.There are minor members called asteroids.An asteroid is an irregular  lump of rock that orbits the Sun.They are in large numbers in a belt between the orbits of the Mars and the Jupiter,They lie at a distance of 2.2 to 3.3 au.This belt is estimated to have some 40,000 to 50,000 asteroids.Some of them ae so tiny that their diameter cannot be measured with the help of prevalent techniques.Ceres,the biggest of these has a diameter of 1003 to 040 km.It was discovered in 1801.A vesta the brightest asteroid,is the only asteroid which can be seen with the naked eye.Is diameter is 555 km.Hermes,another asteroid which was at a distance of 7,80,000 km form the Earth is now extinct.It is not known how asteroids came into being.Some astronomers think that they are broken pieces  of some planet which once existed between the Mars nad the Jupiter.Others consider them as pieces  broken off the Mars and Jupiter themselves.Some asteroids may be chips nadfragments of comets.</p><br>


			<h3>METEORS AND METEORITES</h3>
			<p>Sometimes we see a luminous object moving vary fast and leaving a streak of light behind it across the sky which suddenly disappears.Itis generally called a falling star.But we know that stars never fall.These tiny bodies  which appears to fall are not stars but meteors.They enter Earth's atmosphere with a remendous speed and burn up as a result of  frictional heating.This heat causes the meteoroid to glow.Meteors also are the members  of the solar system.Meteors do not reach the Earth.Most of  them either burn up and disappear o thier  journey or are converted into vapour and dust.Where a meteor does not burnup completely,it falls down and hits the Earth.When the ,meteoroid hits the Earth's surface,it is called a meteorite.</p><br>

			<p>Craters have been formed on the surface of the Moon,the Mars and the Mercury as a result of meteorites hitting the ground.The biggest such crater in Arizona was created by some meteroite.Its diameter is 1265 meters and depth 175 meters.Around 25 million visible meteors are estimated to enter Earth's atmosphere everyday.They have a speed of 35-95 km per second.An orfinary meteor takes approximately one second to convert itself into vapour.About 500 meteorites hit the surface of the Earth in a year's period.The largest known meteorite found in 1920 at Hoba West near Grootfontein at south-west Africa weighte about 60,000 kg.It hit the ground during pre-historic age.Calcuttamuseum has some meteorites as exhibits.</p>


			<h3>COMETS</h3>
			<p>A comet is a heavenly body with a long glowing tail of light behind it.It is also called  'tailed star'.Long ago people feared it because they considered it inauspicious.But now people do not think  that way because they have known the truth.Comets also are members of the Sun's family like other heavenly bodies.They have a definite orbit kike that of the Earth.However,they have shape different to that of the Earth.About 1000 comets have passed  by the Sun during 100 years,Of them,some are bright enough to be seen without telescope.The most important among them is Halley's comet,which passes the Sun every 76 years.It was discovered by the English  astronomer Edmond Halley in 1682 and was named after him.Recently it was seen in 1986.</p><br>

			<p>A comet has three parts-nucleus,coma and tail.Nucleus is the brightest part of the comet.It may have the diameter of 100 to 10,000 meters.The nucleus  of Halley's comet has a diameter of 5,000 meter.Composed of ice,s=dust and gas,the dirty snowball called nucleus shines through the  centre of its head.The part surrounding the nucleus is called  coma.It is made up of gases and dust and ma have a diameter of more than 2 million km.Coma is surrounded by the clouds of comet.It is of two varities - dust tail and plasma tail.The length of a dust tail may vary from 1 to 10 million km.,while that of a  plasma tail,composed of extremely hot ionised gases up to 100 million km.A comet develops the tail as it comes near the Sun.The sunlight pushes away some gas from its head.It is this gas which starts sharing and looks like a tail.As the comet approaches the Sun it rushes with a great speed along with its bright shining tail.The tail of a comet always points away from the Sun.</p><br>

			<h3>EXPLORING THE SPACE</h3>
			<p>The space age began on October 4,1957 when Russia launched the first artificial satellite Sputnik-1 and one month later,Sputnik-2 was launched with a dog,'Laika'aboard,the first living creature in space.This suggested  that  human beings might survive in the space..The first US satellite explorer-1 was put into space on January 31,1958.Thus,the Russian Sputniks and US Explorer pioneered the space exploration programme.The first manned Rusian satellite Vostok-1 was put into space to go round the Earth on April 12,1961.Vostok-1 carried Col.Yuri Gaagari who became the first cosmonaut to complete an orbit of the Earth and to observe the Earth and the sky from the space.</p><br>

			<p>The first woman to go into space in 1963 was USSR'S lT.Col.Valentina,Tereshkova.She completed 48 orbits in 2 days,22 hours and 21 minutes in Vostok-6.In March,1965.Aleksei Leonov,aboarding the Soviet Voskhod-2 became the first man to walk in space.Edward Whitr,the US astronaut of the spacecraft Gemini 4 was the first US  astronaut to make a space outside his craft in the space for 21 minutes.In 1965,began the series of two-en Gemini flights.The team of astronauts  for the Gemini programme practised rendezvous manoeuvres,docking procedure  and space walk in preparation for the Apollo missions to the moon.</p><br>

			<h3>JOURNEY TO THE MOON</h3>
			<p>The three-menned Apollo-2 which had enough space for the astronauts not only to move about but also to stand erect within it,set out on a journey to the moon on July 16,1969,The special feature of Apollo's landing on the moon was that its two astronauts could touch the surface of the moon with the help of the four legged lunar module 'Eagle'.At 10.56 p.m. on July 20,1969,Neil Armstrong set his foot on the moon.In his radio communication sent to the Warth Neil Armstrong descibed it as "one small step for a man one giant leap for mankind."Thereafter Edwin Aldrin stepped out on the moon's surface.Micheal Collions remained abroad the Apollo 2 command module in orbit.The two astronauts spend21 hours 35 minutes on themoon.Armtrong moved about for 2 hours and 15 minutes but Aldrin for a lesser duration.During this period they collected samples of moon's rocks and soil weighing over 20 kg.After the success of this mission,the following persons made journey to the moon under the Apollo programme.They brought with them rocks an soil weighing 3800 kg.</p>
